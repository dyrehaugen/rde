It is politically self-inflicted trouble. The industrial nations believe that the climate and nature crises can be solved through a large-scale focus on new economic growth in the \u0026rsquo;new green industries'.\nBut these are not investments to save the climate and nature - they are investments to save the industrial society created by capital and technology.\n\u0026lsquo;Green transition\u0026rsquo; is mostly about finding emergency solutions in the short term - such as:\npush the greenhouse gases down into old oil wells instead of releasing them into the air\ndrive the same distance, if not longer, with electric cars instead of petrol and diesel cars\nuse the same amount of electricity if not more, but from wind turbines and solar panels\netc\nWe have not progressed far with this, but it is already becoming difficult, tiring and expensive - without the hoped for results appearing - greenhouse gas emissions are not decreasing, they are still increasing - after 28 rounds of COP (international climate negotiations - which started in Rio in 1992) .\nBut Norway still believes this will work out well - as long as we give full throttle in \u0026rsquo;the green transition\u0026rsquo;.\nOthers - more and more - have begun to doubt. It is shocking to many that more of all the old business that created the big problems are the same business that will save us from the problems they created.\nSome have already disguied \u0026rsquo;the green transition\u0026rsquo; - it is not a solution, it is just a postponement in order not to have to take the problems properly seriously.\nWhen the scale and seriousness of the climate and nature crises really dawn on us, we will finally understand that we have to look around for a new social model, not just new technologies.\nFigure: Industrial civilization meets the wall\nTwo questions arise:\nWhat is fundamentally wrong with the Western societal model?\nHow can we set a new course towards better societal organisation?\nSome social principles we now govern according to must be discarded - and other social principles that we now lack must be introduced. This transition process will certainly be both demanding and full of conflict.\nWhat principles are we talking about?\nWe know that industrial civilization (capitalism) has been a formidable success - on its own principle (\u0026lsquo;profitabilty reigns\u0026rsquo;) - but not on the planet\u0026rsquo;s. It is this success that must now be reigned in.\nOur economic system has taken too many risks - that must stop. We have created an economy that has grown far more than the climate and nature can tolerate - that must stop. We must move from limited liability enterprise and innovation to responsible frugality and conservation. We must give back much of what we have conquered and plundered from nature.\nWhat is it about capitalism that has made it such a violent growth machine - with such drastic consequences?\nLet me focus on one thing: the ability to concentrate financial resources in a few hands through allowing \u0026rsquo;limited liability\u0026rsquo;. The financial power of the big companies has become absolutely extreme. We have political democracy, but not economic democracy.\nLegal role reversal The companies are allowed to do what they want and as much as they want - as long as they stay within the current regulations. Our laws and regulations have failed to stop companies from destroying the climate and nature.\nThe principle has been that \u0026lsquo;what is not forbidden is permitted\u0026rsquo;. But the legislature has no way of foreseeing all the unfortunate consequences of the companies\u0026rsquo; activities and banning them in advance.\nWe must reverse the burden of proof - what the companies cannot prove is harmless should not be allowed. The principle must be enshrined in the constitution.\nWe need to take less risk We need to move away from \u0026lsquo;cheering on the entrepreneurs\u0026rsquo; and throwing subsidies at them.\nWe must become fundamentally skeptical of all innovation.\nWe have to turn the thinking around - cheer for those who manage with what they have, instead of those who constantly need something new. Cheers to the skeptical and cautious, not to the enterprising and uncritical.\nWhen new ideas that at first glance look good appear, society must take responsibility for critically clarifying all possible impacts and risks. Only when the safety is documented is the green light given for production.\nWhether innovations should be implemented is a societal decision - not something that should be left to the individual entrepreneur or company.\nLiability must be complete and personal, not impersonal and limited. If such a reigning in of the companies\u0026rsquo; operations is not enough - then they must be crushed - the company legislation repealed - only unlimitedly responsible units are allowed to run production. Less strong financial companies will do less damage.\nDemocratic Rationing must replace Money-Governed Markets Our economic system has not only created enormous growth, it has also created enormous inequalities. Markets allowed to operate freely over time generate economic inequalities - a few winners and many losers.\nA sustainable social order requires equality - not inequality.\nDemocratic Rationing involves the allocation of limited resources per head instead of per dollar.\nWhen we have to manage with less, we have to replace markets with rationing.\nSummary: Principles of Planetary Politics Enshrining the precautionary principle in the Constitution\nWhat is not permitted to produce is forbidden to produce\nImpact assessment and life cycle analysis prior to the start of production\nResource pooling without limitations in the individual participants\u0026rsquo; overall liability\nEconomic democracy in production and democratic rationing in distribution\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2024-06-24-planetary-politics/","summary":"Planetary Politics More than Green Transition is needed Norway and most other countries are struggling with the green shift.

However, corrupt local politicians have managed to let in hotel businesses and allowed them to enclose their gardens and pools by fences or walls. After a while the hotel owners think they own the land as well - and put up signs and lock the doors to keep the public out of \u0026rsquo;their\u0026rsquo; part of the public zone.\nOn my beach their is a seafront walk (paséo maritímo) seperating the sandy beach itself from the hotel areas behind. This has for many years been a clear and clean borderline between the public and the private. But wait - something is going on!\nWe have all learned about capitalism\u0026rsquo;s origins with the \u0026rsquo;enclosure process\u0026rsquo; in England:1\nAn important aspect of this process of change was the enclosure of the common land previously held in the open field system where peasants had traditional rights, such as mowing meadows for hay and grazing livestock. Once enclosed, these uses of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be land for commons. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.\nNow, a similar process is taking place on my Spanish beach.\nThere used to be:\nThe sandy beach proper\nThe paséo maritímo\nThe hotel gardens\nBut, the hotel guests from time to time were not happy just swimming in their garden pools - they wanted the real thing - saltwater swimming.\nAlas, they had to cross the paséo maritímo and enter the crowded beach proper.\nAt the time the hotels were constructed the developers had tried to get the whole beach closed off completely. But the corrupt politicians were not corrupt enough or capable of providing this.\nSo now the hotel guests had to mingle with the locals to get their saltwater bath.\nThe locals put their towels on the beach and jump into the sea. Some come with parasols and foldable chairs to make the stay a bit more comfortable. Some bring the whole family, a lot to eat in freezer bags, and stay for the whole day. When the sun goes down they bring all their gear along back home. In the late evening the beach is again empty, open and free. Next morning the first arrivers can settle wherever they want for the day - it\u0026rsquo;s public area.\nProblem is: hotel guests are not comfortable with laying on a towel straight on the sand. Hotel guests not happy means hotel owners not happy.\nHotel owners call upon municipal authorities to allow rented sunchairs (\u0026rsquo;tumbonas\u0026rsquo;) on the public beach. Municipal authorities allow a given number of sunchairs and give a licence to an operator to manage the rentals. Hotel guests now go to the chair depot, pay their fee, get a chair, put it where there is room on the beach and stay happily there for the day.\nHowever, the chair manager is not quite happy. It is a lot of work to collect the chairs and bring them back to the depot in the evening. Chair managers talk with municipal authorities and ask if the chairs could possibly stay in fixed positions instead of being transported back and forth. Municipal authorities think that\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable demand and say ok, but at a slightly higher commision.\nSo, now a part of the public beach has been cut off and designated for privately operated chair rental services, although with a public licence. Still anybody can pass through the chair area on the way to her towel next by - trespassing still allowed!\nThe chair rental is a great success! Hotel guests are happy, some locals also use the service as it is a bit more comfortable than just the towel in the sand. The chair operator is earning a living and paying the commision to the municipality, the mayor is happy as local people are employed and cash is flowing into the municipal coffers. The development of beach chair services is a clear winner!\nAfter a while the chair operator notice that some people are still sitting on their towels - obviously potential new customers if he just were allowed to put up more chairs. He approach the municipal authorities and asks for an extended licence. OK - the beach is still big - a few more chairs should not be a big problem - people can still walk down between the chairs and get their swim. The authorities accept the request and increase their commision proportionally.\nNow almost half of the beach has been turned into chair-area and some politicians think it is enough. The chair operator is still a private business on public beach. Pure extension of number of chairs and designated area is no longer an option for expanding his business.\nBut - there must be other ways! So he thinks - when not quantity, why not quality? If he upgrades some of his chairs to a more comfortable model hotel guests will be willing to pay a higher fee. But his price is regulated, so he again asks the authorities to accept his new two-tier services with a higher fee for the more comfortable model. And - oh - the more comfortable model is a little bigger so he needs just a little more space for this section on the beach. Municipal authorites are happy with such an entrepreneurial operator and the added commision is very welcome - so OK! Never mind 60% of the beach is now chair area - people can still swim in the sea.\nThe upper strata of hotel guests - those with adequate financial means - thinks the new upper class service is most welcome and the comfortable chairs are easily filled. Operator is happy, municipally is happy - yet again - development is working. However, these finer guests have a small annoyance - public people at large are tresspassing through the chair area, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit with the comfortable class expectations they had - would it be possible to close off the comfortable section - the public can still pass around it. Operator thinks that\u0026rsquo;s a good idea. He put up some big pots with plants around the wealthy section - clearly an environmental improvement. Between the pots he draws some nice sail-ropes. It works ! The wealthy get their quiet and the public still play and swim a little away. Nobody can complain, this is a clear improvement. What a nice and inviting beach - although not everybody can stay everywhere, the public still have their space.\nThe operator now has a steady and safe business. There is room for raising the chair fees a little and profit is growing. Now he has just one problem - how to invest his growing funds?\nLooking around from his operator kiosk he thinks: \u0026ldquo;What is missing here?\u0026rdquo;\nAha - they are just swimming, no more! There must be a latent demand for some water-sports! If he could only get allowance from the municipality for put up shop for that in the corner of the beach. Municipality think: \u0026ldquo;How clever this man is\u0026rdquo;. Watersports need labour and a few more people will get a job. Corner of the beach is not the most pleasant and people can still swim. We take a section of the Western end, put out some buoys with lines in the water to let service boats in and out - then water-scooters have access to the open sea directly from the beach - and can land their equipment conveniently. So said so done. Now working ribs with large outboard motors are going in and out in the lined channel - swimmers stay out of this area of the bay. Never mind the exhausts flowing at the water surface - it\u0026rsquo;s just 10-20m beyond the line where it is unpleasant to breathe - swimmers who don\u0026rsquo;t like that can go a little more East. Never mind also that now 80% of the beach is chair rental or water-sports - people looks joyfull and playfull and the sun is shining.\nSo the licenced operator\u0026rsquo;s entrepreneurial business model is working, - surprise! -surprice! - even on the public beach. The beach may no longer so easily be classified as \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo;, but who cares - municipality income is also growing in the process.\nHowever, paying chair-renters not only like comfortable chairs, they like good eating to, and the nearby cafes along the paséo maritímo is not the very best. The operator put his eyes on the nearby small island - now only palms and grass and a few flowers - but still a nice place for anybody to get even more closer to the sea than on the beach, and for fishing. If he could only get a small parcel there, he could put up a small restaurant and maybe after a while a chair-area and a chill-out to even upgrade from his comfort-class on the beach. But it was public land and the municipality would have to agree - profits should sufficient to cover a reasonable commision.\nSo he tried - and it worked and the island business became a great success. Never mind that a few people had to be excluded from their favourite places - there were still ways around for strollers. He put up a nice wall with glass windows on top to shield his guests from the wind and keep the strollers out - they were very welcome if they sat down and bought an expensive meal, but no trespassing, please. But not everybody took the message - some kept coming along the wall for the sea-swim and even put thier towels on his wall. He had to put up posters to educate them - and after some time they learned to stay away from his property!\nYears went by and business stabilized. Funds accrued and the operator had to turn his head twice to find an new expansion opportunity. Water sports? There were other sports too! Why not start a rental service for beach-buggies - you know this four-wheel rough sports vehicles with big motors they use in Brazil to drive along the endless beaches there.\nAlthough here were no endless beach - only small streches between cliffs - and motor driving was prohibited there, only allowed in the water with the scooters that he already operated. However these vehicles were perfect for climbing the hills, and a lot of the youth renting his water-scooters would certainly like to try the land version if he could easily give them a good offer. So one day he just put up a few beach-buggies for show aside the water-sports pavillion on the beach and made a poster explaining the new service. The buggies are just parked there for marketing and should not annoy anybody - even if it is a public area on a public beach. When the renters go out with their vehicles they just have to drive carefully among the pedestrian on the paséo maritíma a few hundred meters before they get out on the road to the hills. That should not annoy anybody and the municipality has give him licence and share a bit of his profits through a reasonable commision.\nSo although the public beach is no longer just that, development is clearly to the better and everybody is happy.\nI for my part has found another more quiet small beachlet a distance away where the benefits of progress have not yet arrived.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2023-12-13-capitalism-is-creeping-up-on-my-beach/","summary":"Each morning or afternoon I go to the nearby beach for swimming.\nHere in Spain the beach zone (100m) is declared public land.

This if the law of the market society.\nNot paying attention to this gradual rise of inequality is liberalism\u0026rsquo;s blindness.\nHow can a society go on with such a blindness\nfor so many year?\nwith so devasting consequences?\nBreeding Fascism In the end it created a monster - the monster of Donald Trump.\nBut this is not the first time. Liberalism has created monsters before: fascism and Mussolini, nazism and Hitler and a lot of other smaller ones.\nSo we knew the story: liberalism over time breeds fascism. Trump is just the new brand for an old story.\nAre the powerholders under a liberal era just blind or do they see and welcome the emerging fascism?\nIs it fascism that emerges as a \u0026lsquo;solution\u0026rsquo; to the problems liberal capitalism itself creates?\nTrump will only make things worse Certainly a lot of Americans now thinks Trump is a solution - as italians thought Mussolini was their solution and germans thought Hitler was.\nFarooqi rejetcs Trumps policy and thinks is will rather create additional problems. In the end neither fascism or nazism provided anything else than fake solutions - and catastrophes.\nGovernments can accelerate liberalism (technology) But Farooqi stays on within liberalism - his alternative is rather more of the same although by governement action - not laissez faire.\nHis reasoning is briefly like this:\nMuch of the withering of the middle class is an effect of the technology information \u0026lsquo;revolution\u0026rsquo;. Managers can now control production processes with it-tools without the need for a stratum of middlemen - and also with fewer workers.\nFigure: Hollowing out The Middle - Change in job growth by job quality. US 1990-2010\nThe problem with liberalism is that is sees technological change as an exogenous force - market and society just has to adapt.\nHowever, this does not need to be so - \u0026rsquo;technology is endogenous to our institutional arrangements\u0026rsquo; as Farooqi puts it. Government can support some lines of technology and suppress others. \u0026lsquo;A carefully-designed technology policy ought to be one of the pillars of open-ended American developmentalism\u0026rsquo;.\nFarooqi calls for a \u0026lsquo;forced pace of the automation of all routine tasks\u0026rsquo; - reducing the numbers of deskilled jobs. Why? \u0026lsquo;Human workers are great bundles of skill. Using them as automata is a poor use of their human capital.\u0026rsquo; This opens for reallocation of human capital towards more productive activities. \u0026lsquo;Automation does not cause aggregate job losses. Rather, automation reconfigures what tasks are bundled together as jobs, increasing their creative content, reducing drudgery, and making them more rewarding for workers.\u0026rsquo;\nIt should be said that Farooqi\u0026rsquo;s context is the China-US confrontation. His main worry is Trump\u0026rsquo;s protectionism. Rather he still thinks the US can anew outperform China, if only the government steps in and give liberalism an extra push.\nThere are two pillars of accelerated liberalism: upskilling the workforce and keep trade open.\nIt will be an long-term effort - aiming at reskilling one hundred million Americans over the next decade, \u0026lsquo;constantly refining our strategy to upgrade the skill-set of the American populace — for it is human capital that is the true font of productivity\u0026rsquo;.\nIn trade the US cannot prevent China from catching-up. The only chance is for the US to \u0026lsquo;run harder itself\u0026rsquo;.\nRethinking Liberalism Can this accelerated liberalism on government support really save us from the breeding fascism?\nI do not think so.\nNumber one: Somehow we are already \u0026lsquo;overskilled\u0026rsquo; - it shows in the shrinking wage premium of college education. There is no way for the whole majority to upskill into the 1%. Capitalism only gets more and more concentrated.\nNumber two: Keeping trade open will only increase the process of capital concentration. Liberalism has lost the globalization game due to it\u0026rsquo;s blindness.\nToday the setting is different: There are other values than entrepreneurial freedom and profit maximization. Liberalism has to take the back seat. We need governments that aim for the collective health of the planet and scale down economic activity for humankind to survive it\u0026rsquo;s own productivity.\nThe breeding fascism has to be countered by redesigning society for equality and collectivity, not economic growth.\nhttps://policytensor.substack.com/p/notes-on-us-china-policy\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2023-11-13-liberalisms-blindness/","summary":"The Decline of America Anusar Farooqi (\u0026lsquo;Policy Tensor\u0026rsquo;) has provided an excellent discussion1 of how the decline of America come about and what can(?) be done to reverse it - and why Trump does not have the answers.\nHe does not discuss who have been responsible for the decline or whether it could have been omitted.\nIn my mind there is one culprit: liberalism.\nLet me explain:\nThe Law of The Market Society Liberalism potently exploits egoism - calling for individual freedom (of enterprise) and forgetting the importance of collective values and equality of rights and endowments.","title":"Liberalisms Blindness"},{"content":"Branko Milanovic thinks human needs are infinite and that both Keynes and Marx where wrong to think otherwise.\nEven best among the economists, like Ricardo and Keynes (in “The economic prospects of our grandchildren”) thought that human needs are limited. We should know better today: the needs are unlimited and because we cannot forecast the exact movements in technology, we cannot forecast what particular form such new needs will take. But we know that our needs are not finite.\nI beg to differ (see comment on the above link):\nHuman needs are finite - capitalism\u0026rsquo;s needs are infinite. Your argumentation is based on infinite capitalism. Today we should know better.\nThis caused Pechmerle to counter:\nHuman needs are not finite. This is partly a semantic issue - the definition of \u0026ldquo;need.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps if we spoke of \u0026ldquo;wants\u0026rdquo; instead, you would recognize that BM\u0026rsquo;s comment is true. Ten years ago I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have got - and didn\u0026rsquo;t know it would (or perhaps even then did) exist - classical radio over the internet. Now that it does, readily, exist I am listening to a classical broadcast from France while typing this comment. I love this capability, and bought a stereo receiver that has the wifi utility built in. There are many wants like this, and as BM postulates there will surely be many new ones we have not yet foreseen. In my grandparents generation, radio broadcasts were at first non-existent, and then later something they consumed every single day.\nMy response to this was:\nWants are not needs. Wants are socially constructed. Most wants are unneeded.Why else would we \u0026rsquo;need\u0026rsquo; the marketing business?\nKevin Kelly adds in an interview with Noah Smith:\nOur technologies are ultimately not contrary to life, but are in fact an extension of life, enabling it to develop yet more options and possibilities at a faster rate. Increasing options and possibilities is also known as progress, so in the end, what the technium brings us humans is progress.\nTechnium is Kelly-speak for \u0026rsquo;the interacting web of technologies'.\nSo if technium is part of life, then \u0026lsquo;human\u0026rsquo; needs will be infinite. This seems to be the way Branko also is thinking.\nBut are technologies part of life?\nAnd are progress the same as increasing options?\nAn isolated theoretical discussion of these isssues may be is a little far-fetched. What is the relevance of those questions?\nBoth Marx and Keynes had a vision of sufficiency as the final outcome of progress. In the end human needs are finite and we have learned to live a life with what we have and be happy with that.\nThis is of course contrary to capitalism\u0026rsquo;s inherent need for accumulation. History has constructed an economic system based on survival by growth. If you don\u0026rsquo;t grow your business you will go down.\nIn the last century, however, an environmental opposision to this worldview emerged - the sustainability debate. Sorman and Giampietro (2013) gives this nice summary:\n\u0026ldquo;In the 1970s Ehrlich and Holdren proposed the\n$$I = P A T$$\nrelation, where I - Impact on the environment; P - Population; A - Afﬂuence; T - Technology.\nThis relation indicates that the stress on both environment and natural resources is due to a simultaneous increase of human population (number of people - an extensive variable) and the afﬂuence of society (the level of consumption per capita - an intensive variable). The increase in the two terms - P and A cannot be compensated by increases in efﬁciency - T - that is, better technology.\nThe analysis of Ehrlich and Holdern developed a furious debate, which, in the 1970s, divided the scientists concerned with sustainability amid the two sides:\n(i) The cornucopians - believers in the perpetual growth. For those, regardless of whatever increase in P (population size) and A (afﬂuence); this will always be compensated by an increase in efﬁciency T (better technology/silver bullets); and\n(ii) The prophets of doom - those saying that in a ﬁnite planet perpetual growth is not possible, no matter what technology will be invented. For them, all the three terms on the right side of the equation (PAT) should be changed simultaneously, in an integrated way, to maintain the activity of humankind within the carrying capacity of our planet. We can recall here the famous quote of Kenneth E. Boulding saying that: “Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a ﬁnite world is either a madman or an economist”.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter Limits to Growth in the 1970 the debate went out of steam as the cornucopians seemed to have won during the neo-liberal era. Now however the debate is back due to the relentless progress of climate change - may be there are limits after all?\nOf course, the declared techo-optimists are still fighting - today under the name of Green New Deal or Green Transition - capitalism is the solution to the problems capitalism has created - growth can go on - human needs are infinite.\nThe degrowth camp fights back from the position of sufficiency happiness and planetary boundaries to capitalisms expansion - growth has to stop - human needs are finite.\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2023-03-08-are-human-needs-infinite/","summary":"Branko Milanovic thinks human needs are infinite and that both Keynes and Marx where wrong to think otherwise.\nEven best among the economists, like Ricardo and Keynes (in “The economic prospects of our grandchildren”) thought that human needs are limited.

Lars Calmfors in DN 22 feb 2021. The notice is triggered by his involvement in a Norwegian Green Paper Commision on Labour and Income Policy. NOU 2019:7. The Commision shouldpropose new measures to increase labour participation in Norway.\nInternationally the Nordic (sometimes only Scandinavian) countries are mostly treated as fairly much of the same under the heading of \u0026lsquo;The Nordic Model\u0026rsquo;. This article however points to the particularities of Norway compared to Sweden.\nCalmfors\u0026rsquo;s main point is that Norway will not be able to tackle both decreasing oil returns and high levels of health-related labour market absense when at the same time the population is quickly aging.\nAs expected the economists look to \u0026lsquo;increased labour market participation\u0026rsquo; as the \u0026lsquo;key factor\u0026rsquo; to tackle the problems Norway is now fronting. (This was in their mandate).\nCompared to Sweden the percentage of people living on health-related social contributions are much higher in Norway (17 pct around the double of Sweden). Calmfors interprets this figure av \u0026lsquo;medicalization of labour market problems\u0026rsquo; - which might for sure be true.\nWhen discussing what to do about this situation the differences to Sweden come to the surface. The Nowegian way is quite more corporativistic than what could happen in Sweden. After receiving expert proposals from the economists the Commision is enlarged with participants from Employers and Labour Unions plus from Government. Together they are charged with finding (for all) acceptable ways forwards.\nThis way of working together (3-party co-operation) to me lies at the heart of the \u0026lsquo;Nordic Model\u0026rsquo;, so I am a bit surprised by learning from Calmfors that this is not the way it works in Sweden? May be the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; is not the same as the \u0026lsquo;Nordic Model\u0026rsquo; after all? Calmfors\u0026rsquo;s conclusion is that this cooperative mode paired with strong egalitarian drives will create great obstacles for getting more people involved on the labour market.\nMay be he is right in this. But to me it sounds like an argument to skip the core of the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; - for something more neo-liberalistic? That would be out of date. The Reagan-Thatcher era is long gone - if not yet among mainstream economists.\nHowever, to my mind Norway faces problems at the end of the oil age that calls for looking much more broadly into the strategy of economic transition for the coming decades. Strikingly the issue of greening the economy is out of focus for this commision. But let me first take a look at the workings of the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; - which has been in operation from the mid 1930s up till now - and may be longer?\nThe Norwegian Way An interesting analysis of the \u0026lsquo;Scandinavian Model\u0026rsquo; is found in Barth 2014 (pdf)\nThe conclusion of this work is as follows (my emphasis):\nWhy has the Scandinavian model worked so well? And, why have its institutions and policies survived, in spite of changing economic and political circumstances? Our answer to both questions is that there is a strong complementarity between the Scandinavian non-market institutions and capitalist dynamics.\nOur paper emphasizes the political–economic equilibrium between three sets of mechanisms. Encompassing organizations in the labor market follow a policy of wage coordination and wage compression, with a strong preference for full employment in central bargaining and microeconomic efficiency in local bargaining. Wage compression leads to a higher pace of creative destruction and further wage compression with an increasing average wage. More wage equality and higher average wages fuel the political support for welfare spending. There might even be a feedback from public welfare policies to productivity rise and further wage compression. This complementarity explains why the same outcomes—efficiency and a high level of equality—could not have been achieved by redistribution through the political system alone. This political-economic equilibrium path has benefitted from consistent policies that have supplemented market forces. Active labor market programs and moderations on employment protection have been important policies to facilitate structural change and reallocation of labor without excessive wage differentials.\nA similar concern for consistency is evident from the extensive use of ‘work-fare’ policies, which are used in Denmark, Norway and Sweden to ensure that work pays in the presence of generous welfare benefits. High employment reduces the cost of a generous benefit system and increases the tax base. Active job search or qualification efforts are for example required in order to obtain unemployment benefits.\nIn sum, the complementarity between the non-market institutions and capitalist investments help explain why the main institutions and policies have survived over 80 years. The gains are spread widely across groups. There are many winners and few losers. Both low paid groups and employers are clear winners as wage compression and rising profits are two sides of the same coin. High skilled workers are potential losers. But also high skilled workers may gain from wage moderation, as the average productivity goes up.\nThe stability of the Scandinavian model can in part be explained by the good performance, and the good performance must have been helped by the stability of the model. The key is that both depend on the egalitarian aspects of the Scandinavian model that share the gains of good performance on almost all groups. Since the interactions be- tween wage coordination, investments, and welfare spending all strengthen the egalitarian aspects of the model, it would not be possible to achieve the same egalitarian results by redistribution through the welfare state only.\nSo - the \u0026lsquo;Nordic / Scandinavian / Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; turns out to be just a smart way to let capitalism evolve. And it has worked well - on that premise - so far.\nThe model\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;golden age\u0026rsquo; was before 1980. But the neoliberal era - from 1980 onwards has created some dilemmas- which might be read in the constant decline of the labour parties in all the Nordic countries during the last couple of decades.\nThe alliance between Labour and Capital was based on mutual benefits: Labour Organizations accepted wage restraints as long as capitalist continued investing in project that created increade number of jobs. However in the 1980\u0026rsquo;s this closed loop was broken be globalization. Capitalist\u0026rsquo;s started putting the money into China and other developing countries instead of investing at home. Labour is no longer on the winning side of the play. The gains are no longer as widely spread across groups. As in other countries there is a rising precariate.\nThis has been most visible in the other Nordic countries - for Norway the oil money came in between as a saving angel - allowing for such \u0026rsquo;economic diseases\u0026rsquo; as 17% health-related social contributions to people not participating in the labour market. Thus, the coming end of the oil era put Norway up for greater challenges than the other Nordic countries, as Calmfors rightly explained.\nTo green the economy while at the same time get out of \u0026lsquo;oil addiction\u0026rsquo; is really a double challenge.\nTo find the way forwards one will need a lot more than main-stream econmic thinking a la Calmfors.\nA starting point could be an \u0026rsquo;evolutionary economics\u0026rsquo; approach. Interesting extension in the understanding of how the \u0026lsquo;Norwegian Model\u0026rsquo; works come from Wlison and Hessen (2015). (My emphasis)\nThe success of the so-called “Nordic Model” is commonly attributed to factors such as income equality, a high level of trust, high willingness to pay tax, which is tightly coupled to strong social security (health, education), a blend of governmental regulations and capitalism, and cultural homogeneity. These and other factors are important, but we think that viewing them through an evolutionary lens is likely to shed light on why they are important. Our hypothesis is that Norway functions well as a nation because it has successfully managed to scale up the social control mechanisms that operate spontaneously in village-sized groups. Income equality, trust, and the other factors attributed to Norway’s success emanate from the social control mechanisms.\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2021-02-26-the-case-of-norway/","summary":"Nordic differences My Swedish friend Torbjörn just sent me a paper clip containing a notice of a Swedish economics professor commenting on the economic situation in Norway.

Naomi Klein\u0026rsquo;s 2014 book \u0026lsquo;This Changes Everything\u0026rsquo; concluded that Capitalism as such really was what created the Climate Crisis.

John Kay wish we did not use it - thinking it is an obsolete label for today\u0026rsquo;s economic system.\nThe ongoing debate is an entertaining exposition of sliding concepts and language - however, on a very dark and solemn background.\nThe major divide is between those advocating \u0026lsquo;Green Growth will solve the Problem\u0026rsquo; and those saying \u0026lsquo;Growth is the Problem, even if it is green\u0026rsquo;. Among the latter are Jason Hickel and Giorgis Kallis. This hinges on the very question of whether Capitalism is possible without Growth.

Companies like Google or Amazon can use their data to predict regional sales growth or job losses. Google Trends is just one example of the power of aggregation from individual search information. This poses a challenge going forward that is structural and intellectual. On the one hand we need to think about how central banks can get visibility of the types of data that private-sector institutions are collecting as part of their core business. On the intellectual side the availability of this hyper-granular data asks for a new way of building economic models based on individual purchase or borrowing decisions. This is a challenge to the whole field of (macro)economics.\nBruegel on monetary policy and superstar firms\nAntoinette Schoar (pdf)\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2019-01-28-hypergranular-macroeconomics/","summary":"The Bruegel blog of September 4, 2018 reports from the annual Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers.

However, Paul Krugman now argues that the theory was - and is - \u0026lsquo;good enough for government\u0026rsquo;. The failure of 2008 was not in the theory, but rather in deficient data collection. Macroeconomists \u0026ldquo;overlooked\u0026rdquo; the institutional changes in the financial sector and did not record appropriate data.\nThe \u0026ldquo;New Keynesians\u0026rdquo; - i.e. Krugman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Saltwater School\u0026rsquo; based at MIT and Harvard - took up the challenge by dust[ing] off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things:\nVery large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates. Even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates. There would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation. Krugman argues that these propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008 which worked “remarkably well.” This New Keynesian policy was a succes - in contrast to the more inflexible responses promoted by the \u0026lsquo;Freshwater - Chicago School\u0026rsquo;.\nHowever, fiscal expansion was soon replaced by austerity.\nKrugman\u0026rsquo;s version is not taken at face value by Robert Skidelsky who argues that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons. Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned.\nThe problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times. Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved. They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental.\nWithout acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart. New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job. So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive. Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.\nSkidelsky\nKrugman\n","permalink":"https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rde/posts/2018-01-25-krugmans-explanations/","summary":"Mainstream economics failure to \u0026lsquo;see the crisis coming\u0026rsquo; in 2008 is broadly regarded as a deficiency of the theory.

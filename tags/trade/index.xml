      <description>FINALLY - DONALD WILL MAKE IT!
Millions and millions of people have worked to destroy the American empire, and all of them failed. Now Donald is succeeding!
The neoliberal trade order since the late 80s was designed to destroy countries’ sovereignty, making it impossible to truly regulate investors, to run industrial policy, or even, in rich nations, to keep wages up. Donald puts an end to it!
Europeans always listened to America.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FINALLY - DONALD WILL MAKE IT!</strong></p>
<p>Millions and millions of people have worked to destroy the American empire, and all of them failed. Now Donald is succeeding!</p>
<p>The neoliberal trade order since the late 80s was designed to destroy countries’ sovereignty, making it impossible to truly regulate investors, to run industrial policy, or even, in rich nations, to keep wages up. Donald puts an end to it!</p>
<p>Europeans always listened to America. Donald is forcing the Europeans to stop doing what America says.</p>
<p>This should have happened decades ago, and EU elites failure to man-up has cost Europe’s countries dearly.</p>
<p>The NATO should have been disbanded when the USSR fell.</p>
<p>The EU has been the neoliberal implementation engine in Europe, securing stagnation and de-industrialization, especially since the introduction of the Euro.
Donald speeds up the end of the American Empire, and the end of the “no industrial policy, no sovereignty” free trade order, and possibly the end of NATO and the American occupation of Europe.</p>
<p>For the first time since the US imposed its terrible neoliberal trade order on the world, there is at least a chance for most countries to be able to properly manage their own economic affairs.</p>
<p>Thanks Donald!</p>

      <title>Liberalisms Blindness</title>

      <description>The Decline of America Anusar Farooqi (&amp;lsquo;Policy Tensor&amp;rsquo;) has provided an excellent discussion1 of how the decline of America come about and what can(?) be done to reverse it - and why Trump does not have the answers.
He does not discuss who have been responsible for the decline or whether it could have been omitted.
In my mind there is one culprit: liberalism.
Let me explain:
The Law of The Market Society Liberalism potently exploits egoism - calling for individual freedom (of enterprise) and forgetting the importance of collective values and equality of rights and endowments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-decline-of-america">The Decline of America</h2>
<p>Anusar Farooqi (&lsquo;Policy Tensor&rsquo;) has provided an excellent <a href="https://policytensor.substack.com/p/notes-on-us-china-policy">discussion</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of how the
<em>decline of America</em> come about and what can(?) be done to <em>reverse</em> it -
and why <em>Trump does not have the answers</em>.</p>
<p>He does not discuss <em>who have been responsible</em> for the decline or
whether it <em>could have been omitted</em>.</p>
<p>In my mind there is one culprit: <strong>liberalism</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me  explain:</p>
<h2 id="the-law-of-the-market-society">The Law of The Market Society</h2>
<p>Liberalism potently exploits egoism - calling for <em>individual freedom (of enterprise)</em>
and forgetting the importance of collective values and equality of rights
and endowments.</p>
<p>Over time growth excels at the costs of increasing inequality.
This if the law of the <em>market society</em>.</p>
<p>Not paying attention to this gradual rise of inequality is <strong>liberalism&rsquo;s blindness</strong>.</p>
<p>How can a society go on with such a blindness</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for so many year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with so devasting consequences?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breeding-fascism">Breeding Fascism</h2>
<p>In the end it created a <em>monster</em> - the monster of <em>Donald Trump</em>.</p>
<p>But this is not the first time.
Liberalism has created monsters before: <em>fascism and Mussolini</em>,
<em>nazism  and Hitler</em> and a lot of other smaller ones.</p>
<p>So we knew the story: <em>liberalism over time breeds fascism</em>.
Trump is just the new brand for an old story.</p>
<p>Are the powerholders under a liberal era just <strong>blind</strong> or
do they see and <em>welcome the emerging fascism</em>?</p>
<p>Is it <em>fascism that emerges as a &lsquo;solution&rsquo;</em> to the problems
liberal capitalism itself creates?</p>
<h2 id="trump-will-only-make-things-worse">Trump will only make things worse</h2>
<p>Certainly a lot of Americans <em>now thinks Trump is a solution</em> -
as italians thought Mussolini was their solution and
germans thought Hitler was.</p>
<p>Farooqi rejetcs Trumps policy and thinks is will rather create
additional problems. In the end neither fascism or nazism
provided anything else than fake solutions - and catastrophes.</p>
<h2 id="governments-can-accelerate-liberalism-technology">Governments can accelerate liberalism (technology)</h2>
<p>But Farooqi stays on <em>within</em>  liberalism - his alternative
is rather <em>more of the same</em> although by governement
action -  not laissez faire.</p>
<p>His reasoning is briefly like this:</p>
<p>Much of the withering of the middle class is an effect of
the technology information &lsquo;revolution&rsquo;.
Managers can now control production processes with it-tools
without the need for a stratum of middlemen -
and also with fewer workers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/rde/fig/us_job_quality_shift.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p><em>Figure: Hollowing out The Middle -
Change in job growth by job quality.
US 1990-2010</em></p>
<p>The problem with liberalism is that is sees technological change
as an exogenous force - market and society just has to adapt.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be so - &rsquo;technology is endogenous
to our institutional arrangements&rsquo; as Farooqi puts it.
Government can support some lines of technology and suppress others.
&lsquo;A carefully-designed technology policy ought to be one of the
pillars of open-ended American developmentalism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Farooqi calls for a &lsquo;forced pace of the automation of all routine tasks&rsquo; -
reducing the numbers of deskilled jobs. Why?
&lsquo;Human workers are great bundles of skill.
Using them as automata is a poor use of their human capital.&rsquo;
This opens for reallocation of human capital towards more productive
activities.
&lsquo;Automation does not cause aggregate job losses.
Rather, automation reconfigures what tasks are
bundled together as jobs, increasing their creative content, reducing
drudgery, and making them more rewarding for workers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should be said that Farooqi&rsquo;s  context is the China-US confrontation.
His main worry is Trump&rsquo;s protectionism.
Rather he still thinks the US can anew outperform China,
if only the government steps in and give liberalism an extra push.</p>
<p>There are two pillars of accelerated liberalism:
upskilling the workforce and keep trade open.</p>
<p>It will be an long-term effort - aiming at
<strong>reskilling one hundred million Americans over the next decade</strong>,
&lsquo;constantly refining our strategy to upgrade the skill-set of the
American populace — for it is human capital that is the true
font of productivity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In trade the US cannot prevent China from catching-up.
The only chance is for the US to &lsquo;run harder itself&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-liberalism">Rethinking Liberalism</h2>
<p>Can this <em>accelerated liberalism on government support</em> really
save us from the <em>breeding fascism</em>?</p>
<p>I do not think so.</p>
<p>Number one: Somehow we are already &lsquo;overskilled&rsquo; - it shows
in the shrinking wage premium of college education.
There is no way for the whole majority to upskill  into the 1%.
Capitalism only gets more and more concentrated.</p>
<p>Number two: Keeping trade open will only increase the
process of capital concentration.
Liberalism has lost the globalization game due to it&rsquo;s <strong>blindness</strong>.</p>
<p>Today the setting is different:
There are other values than <em>entrepreneurial freedom and profit maximization</em>.
Liberalism has to take the back seat.
We need governments that aim for the collective health of the planet
and <em>scale down economic activity</em> for humankind to survive
it&rsquo;s own productivity.</p>
<p>The <em>breeding fascism</em> has to be countered by <em>redesigning society for
equality and collectivity,</em> not economic growth.</p>

      <description>End of an era? Donald Trump has been on his first international trip as President of the U.S. European leaders for the first time in postwar history finds they can no longer trust the U.S. Government. Neither in defence (Nato), climate change (Paris Accord) or trade (TTIP). We are experiencing the slow collapse of the hegemonic US era. Gone are the days of the Washington Concensus and the Neoliberal economic doctrine.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>End of an era? Donald Trump has been on his first international trip as
President of the U.S. European leaders for the first time in postwar history
finds they can no longer trust the U.S. Government. Neither in defence (Nato),
climate change (Paris Accord) or trade (TTIP). We are experiencing the slow
collapse of the hegemonic US era. Gone are the days of the Washington Concensus
and the Neoliberal economic doctrine. The EU establishment seems though to
still cling to these - Merkel &amp; Macron want to pick up the flag abandonned
by the US and to take on a European leadership of prolonged globalisation.
Alas, watershed periods starts with confusion and nostalgia.
Forwards-looking policies are still waiting to emerge.</p>

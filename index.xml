      <description>Capitalism is creeping up on my Beach Each morning or afternoon I go to the nearby beach for swimming.
Here in Spain the beach zone (100m) is declared public land. However, corrupt local politicians have managed to let in hotel businesses and allowed them to enclose their gardens and pools by fences or walls.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="capitalism-is-creeping-up-on-my-beach">Capitalism is creeping up on my Beach</h1>
<p>Each morning or afternoon I go to the nearby beach for swimming.</p>
<p>Here in Spain the beach zone (100m) is declared public land.
However, corrupt local politicians have managed to let in hotel businesses
and allowed them to enclose their gardens and pools by fences or walls.
After a while the hotel owners think they own the land as well -
and put up signs and  lock the doors to keep the public out of &rsquo;their&rsquo; part of
the public zone.</p>
<p>On my beach their is a seafront walk (paséo maritímo) seperating
the sandy beach itself from the hotel areas behind.
This has for many years been a clear and clean borderline
between the public and the private.
But wait - something is going on!</p>
<p>We have all learned about capitalism&rsquo;s origins with the <em>&rsquo;enclosure process&rsquo;</em>
in England:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An important aspect of this process of change was the <em>enclosure of the common land</em> previously held in the open field system where peasants had traditional rights, such as mowing meadows for hay and grazing livestock. Once enclosed, these uses of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be land for commons. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, a similar process is taking place on my Spanish beach.</p>
<p>There used to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sandy beach proper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paséo maritímo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hotel gardens</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But, the hotel guests from time to time were not happy just swimming
in their garden pools - they wanted the real thing - saltwater swimming.</p>
<p>Alas, they had to cross the paséo maritímo and enter the crowded beach proper.</p>
<p>At the time the hotels were constructed the developers had tried to
get the whole beach closed off completely.
But the corrupt politicians were not corrupt enough or capable of
providing this.</p>
<p>So now the hotel guests had to mingle with the locals to get their
saltwater bath.</p>
<p>The locals put their towels on the beach and jump into the sea.
Some come with parasols and foldable chairs to make the stay
a bit more comfortable.
Some bring the whole family, a lot to eat in freezer bags, and stay
for the whole day.
When the sun goes down they bring all their gear along back home.
In the late evening the beach is again empty, open and free.
Next morning the first arrivers can settle wherever they want for the day -
it&rsquo;s public area.</p>
<p>Problem is: hotel guests are not comfortable with laying on a towel
straight on the sand.
Hotel guests not happy means hotel owners not happy.</p>
<p>Hotel owners call upon municipal authorities to allow rented sunchairs (&rsquo;tumbonas&rsquo;)
on the public beach.
Municipal authorities allows a given number of sunchairs and gives
a licence to an operator to manage the rentals.
Hotel guests now go to the chair depot, pay their fee, get a chair, put it
where there is room on the beach and stay happily there for the day.</p>
<p>However, the chair manager is not quite happy.
It is a lot of work to collect the chairs and bring them back to the depot
in the evening.
Chair managers talk with municipal authority and ask if the chairs could
possibly stay in fixed positions instead of being transported back and forth.
Municipal authority thinks that&rsquo;s a reasonable demand and say ok, but at a
slightly higher commision.</p>
<p>So, now a part of the public beach has been cut off and designated
for privately operated chair rental services, although with a public licence.
Still anybody can pass through the chair area on the way to her towel next by -
trespassing still allowed!</p>
<p>The chair rental is a great success! Hotel guests are happy, some  locals
also use the service as it is a bit more comfortable than just the towel
in the sand. The chair operator  is earning a living and paying the
commision to the municipality, the mayor is happy as local people are
employed and cash is flowing into the municipal coffers.
The development of beach chair services is a clear winner!</p>
<p>After a while the chair operator notice that some people are still
sitting on their towels - obviously potential new customers if he just
were allowed to put up  more chairs.
He approach the municipal authorities and asks for an extended licence.
OK - the beach is still big - a few more chairs should not be a big
problem - people can still walk down between the chairs and get their swim.
The authorities accept the request and increase their commision proportionally.</p>
<p>Now almost half of the beach has been turned into chair-area and
some politicians think it is enough.
The chair operator is still a private business on public beach.
Pure extension of number of chairs and designated area is
no longer an option for expanding his business.</p>
<p>But - there must be other ways!
So he thinks - when not quantity, why not quality?
If he upgrades some of his chairs to a more comfortable model
hotel guests will be willing to pay a higher fee.
But his price is regulated, so he again asks the authorities
to accept his new two-tier services with a higher fee for the
more comfortable model.
And - oh - the more comfortable model is a little bigger so he needs
just a little more space for this section on the beach.
Municipal authorites are happy with such an entrepreneurial operator
and the added commision is very welcome - so OK!
Never mind 60% of the beach is now chair area - people can still swim in the sea.</p>
<p>The upper strata of hotel guests - those with adequate financial means -
thinks the new upper class service is most welcome and
the comfortable chairs are easily filled.
Operator is happy, municipally is happy - yet again - development is working.
However, these finer guests have a small annoyance -
public people at large are tresspassing through the chair area,
that doesn&rsquo;t fit with the comfortable class expectations they had -
would it be possible to close off the comfortable section - the public
can still pass around it.
Operator thinks that&rsquo;s a good idea.
He put up some big pots with plants around the wealthy section -
clearly an environmental improvement.
Between the pots he draws some nice sail-ropes.
It works ! The wealthy get their quiet and the public still play and swim
a little away.
Nobody can complain, this is a clear improvement.
What a nice and inviting beach - although not everybody can stay everywhere,
the public still have their space.</p>
<p>The operator now has a steady and safe business.
There is room for raising the chair fees a little and profit is growing.
Now he has just one problem - how to invest his growing funds?</p>
<p>Looking around from his operator kiosk he thinks:
&ldquo;What is missing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aha - they are just swimming, no more!
There must be a latent demand for some water-sports!
If he could only get allowance from the municipality for put
up shop for that in the corner of the beach.
Municipality think: &ldquo;How clever this man is&rdquo;.
Watersports need labour and a few more people will get a job.
Corner of the beach is not the most pleasant and people can still swim.
We take a section of the Western end, put out some buoys with lines
in the water to let service boats in and out - then water-scooters
have access to the open sea directly from the beach - and can land their
equipment conveniently.
So said so done.
Now working ribs with large outboard motors are going in and out in the lined
channel - swimmers stay out of this area of the bay.
Never mind the exhausts flowing at the water surface - it&rsquo;s just
10-20m beyond the line where it is unpleasant to breathe -
swimmers who don&rsquo;t like that can go a little more East.
Never mind also that now 80% of the beach is chair rental or water-sports -
people looks joyfull and playfull and the sun is shining.</p>
<p>So the licenced operator&rsquo;s entrepreneurial business model is
working,  - surprise! -surprice! - even on the public beach.
The beach may no longer so easily be classified as &lsquo;public&rsquo;,
but who cares - munucipality income is also growing in the process.</p>
<p>However, paying chair-renters not only like comfortable chairs,
they like good eating to, and the nearby cafes along the paséo maritímo
is not the very best.
The operator put his eyes on the nearby small island - now only
palms and grass and a few flowers - but still a nice place for
anybody to  get even more closer to the sea than on the beach,
and for fishing.
If he could only get a small parcel there, he could put up a small restaurant
and maybe after a while a chair-area and a chill-out to even
upgrade from his comfort-class on the beach.
But it was public land and the municipality would have to agree -
profits should sufficient to cover a reasonable commision.</p>
<p>So he tried - and it worked and the island business became a great success.
Never mind that a few people had to  be excluded from their favourite
places - there were still ways around for strollers.
He put up a nice wall with glass windows on top to shield his guests
from the wind and keep the strollers out - they were very welcome
if they sat down and bought an expensive meal, but no trespassing, please.
But not everybody took the message - some kept coming along the wall for the
sea-swim and even put thier towels on his wall.
He had to put up posters to educate them - and after some time
they learned to stay away from his property!</p>
<p>Years went by and business stabilized.
Funds accrued and the operator had to turn his head twice to find
an new expansion opportunity.
Water sports? There were other sports too! Why not start a
rental service for beach-buggies - you know this four-wheel rough
sports vehicles with big motors they use in Brazil to drive along
the endless beaches there.</p>
<p>Although here were no endless beach - only small streches between cliffs -
and motor driving was prohibited there, only allowed with in water
with the scooters that he already oprated.
However these vehicles were perfect for climbing the hills,
and a lot of the youth renting his water-scooters would certainly
like to try the land version if he could easily give them a good offer.
So one day he just put up a few beach-buggies for show aside
the water-sports pavillion on the beach and made a poster
explaining the new service.
The buggies are just parked there for marketing and should not
annoy anybody - even if it is a public area on a public beach.
When the renters go out with their vehicles they just have
to drive carefully among the pedestrian on the paséo maritíma
a few hundred meters before they get out on the road to the hills.
That should not annoy anybody and the municipality has give him licence
and share a bit of his profits through a reasonable commision.</p>
<p>So although the public beach is no  longer just that,
development is clearly to  the better and everybody is happy.</p>
<p>I for my part has found another more quiet small beachlet
a distance away where the benefits of progress have not yet arrived.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="israels-delusion">Israels Delusion</h1>
<p>The Hamas attack on 7th October, 2023 shaked the Israeli nation in it&rsquo;s foundations.</p>
<h2 id="occupation-becomes-normality">Occupation becomes Normality</h2>
<p>Jews had acquired an <strong>illusion of safeness</strong> about living in their Jewish republic.</p>
<p>The <em>unruly palestinians</em> were kept at pace outside walls and fences or
by heavy policing within.</p>
<p>The <em>ruly palestinians</em> were pacified by access to Israeli jobs and
pieces of that cake.</p>
<p>The IDF had control in the territories and the PLA cooperated submissively.
Jews could finally enjoy an era of peace and prosperity in &rsquo;their own country'.</p>
<p>The <em>occupation</em> had lasted for half a century or more -
it had become a part of normality that no Jews actually cared about.</p>
<h2 id="palestine-no-longer-existed---in-jewish-minds">Palestine no longer existed - in Jewish minds</h2>
<p>Gaza was out of the Jewish mind - a compound for unwanted &lsquo;aboriginals&rsquo;
forcefully displaced behind a wall - out ofsight, out of mind.</p>
<p>The evil of the <em>Israeli terror</em> neccecary for the expulsion of palestinians
was mentally repressed in Jewish minds and historical memory.
The Jews thought palestinians broken and powerless.
The neigbouring Arab governing elites thought likewise.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-middle-east-was-within-reach">The New Middle-East was within reach</h2>
<p>Palestine was off the table - the time was come for Arab neigbours
to make peace with Israel and bring the Israeli economic dynamism
into a force serving the whole region.
Treaties were made and more were planned.</p>
<h2 id="the-rising-of-the-gaza-ghetto">The Rising of The Gaza Ghetto</h2>
<p>Hamas attack was a desperate move to avoid being ignored and forgotten -
both by the Israeli enemy and by their Arab &lsquo;brothers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If I should compare it to anything it must be the equally desperate
1944 uprising of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-delusions">The two Delusions</h2>
<p>Hitler at that time sought his &lsquo;final solution&rsquo; by killing
the Jews, but extinction was beyond reach.</p>
<p>Israel today seeks its own &lsquo;final  solution&rsquo; by flattening Gaza and
killing Palestinians almost indiscriminately,
but extinction is still beyond reach.</p>
<h2 id="no-peace-no-safety">No Peace, No Safety</h2>
<p>There will be now peace and no safety.</p>
<p>War will go on.</p>
<p>There is no room for a &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; republic with a racist constituion - never.</p>

      <description>The Decline of America Anusar Farooqi (&amp;lsquo;Policy Tensor&amp;rsquo;) has provided an excellent discussion1 of how the decline of America come about and what can(?) be done to reverse it - and why Trump does not have the answers.
He does not discuss who have been responsible for the decline or whether it could have been omitted.
In my mind there is one culprit: liberalism.
Let me explain:
The Law of The Market Society Liberalism potently exploits egoism - calling for individual freedom (of enterprise) and forgetting the importance of collective values and equality of rights and endowments.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-decline-of-america">The Decline of America</h2>
<p>Anusar Farooqi (&lsquo;Policy Tensor&rsquo;) has provided an excellent <a href="https://policytensor.substack.com/p/notes-on-us-china-policy">discussion</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of how the
<em>decline of America</em> come about and what can(?) be done to <em>reverse</em> it -
and why <em>Trump does not have the answers</em>.</p>
<p>He does not discuss <em>who have been responsible</em> for the decline or
whether it <em>could have been omitted</em>.</p>
<p>In my mind there is one culprit: <strong>liberalism</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me  explain:</p>
<h2 id="the-law-of-the-market-society">The Law of The Market Society</h2>
<p>Liberalism potently exploits egoism - calling for <em>individual freedom (of enterprise)</em>
and forgetting the importance of collective values and equality of rights
and endowments.</p>
<p>Over time growth excels at the costs of increasing inequality.
This if the law of the <em>market society</em>.</p>
<p>Not paying attention to this gradual rise of inequality is <strong>liberalism&rsquo;s blindness</strong>.</p>
<p>How can a society go on with such a blindness</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for so many year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with so devasting consequences?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breeding-fascism">Breeding Fascism</h2>
<p>In the end it created a <em>monster</em> - the monster of <em>Donald Trump</em>.</p>
<p>But this is not the first time.
Liberalism has created monsters before: <em>fascism and Mussolini</em>,
<em>nazism  and Hitler</em> and a lot of other smaller ones.</p>
<p>So we knew the story: <em>liberalism over time breeds fascism</em>.
Trump is just the new brand for an old story.</p>
<p>Are the powerholders under a liberal era just <strong>blind</strong> or
do they see and <em>welcome the emerging fascism</em>?</p>
<p>Is it <em>fascism that emerges as a &lsquo;solution&rsquo;</em> to the problems
liberal capitalism itself creates?</p>
<h2 id="trump-will-only-make-things-worse">Trump will only make things worse</h2>
<p>Certainly a lot of Americans <em>now thinks Trump is a solution</em> -
as italians thought Mussolini was their solution and
germans thought Hitler was.</p>
<p>Farooqi rejetcs Trumps policy and thinks is will rather create
additional problems. In the end neither fascism or nazism
provided anything else than fake solutions - and catastrophes.</p>
<h2 id="governments-can-accelerate-liberalism-technology">Governments can accelerate liberalism (technology)</h2>
<p>But Farooqi stays on <em>within</em>  liberalism - his alternative
is rather <em>more of the same</em> although by governement
action -  not laissez faire.</p>
<p>His reasoning is briefly like this:</p>
<p>Much of the withering of the middle class is an effect of
the technology information &lsquo;revolution&rsquo;.
Managers can now control production processes with it-tools
without the need for a stratum of middlemen -
and also with fewer workers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/rde/fig/us_job_quality_shift.png" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p><em>Figure: Hollowing out The Middle -
Change in job growth by job quality.
US 1990-2010</em></p>
<p>The problem with liberalism is that is sees technological change
as an exogenous force - market and society just has to adapt.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be so - &rsquo;technology is endogenous
to our institutional arrangements&rsquo; as Farooqi puts it.
Government can support some lines of technology and suppress others.
&lsquo;A carefully-designed technology policy ought to be one of the
pillars of open-ended American developmentalism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Farooqi calls for a &lsquo;forced pace of the automation of all routine tasks&rsquo; -
reducing the numbers of deskilled jobs. Why?
&lsquo;Human workers are great bundles of skill.
Using them as automata is a poor use of their human capital.&rsquo;
This opens for reallocation of human capital towards more productive
activities.
&lsquo;Automation does not cause aggregate job losses.
Rather, automation reconfigures what tasks are
bundled together as jobs, increasing their creative content, reducing
drudgery, and making them more rewarding for workers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should be said that Farooqi&rsquo;s  context is the China-US confrontation.
His main worry is Trump&rsquo;s protectionism.
Rather he still thinks the US can anew outperform China,
if only the government steps in and give liberalism an extra push.</p>
<p>There are two pillars of accelerated liberalism:
upskilling the workforce and keep trade open.</p>
<p>It will be an long-term effort - aiming at
<strong>reskilling one hundred million Americans over the next decade</strong>,
&lsquo;constantly refining our strategy to upgrade the skill-set of the
American populace — for it is human capital that is the true
font of productivity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In trade the US cannot prevent China from catching-up.
The only chance is for the US to &lsquo;run harder itself&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-liberalism">Rethinking Liberalism</h2>
<p>Can this <em>accelerated liberalism on government support</em> really
save us from the <em>breeding fascism</em>?</p>
<p>I do not think so.</p>
<p>Number one: Somehow we are already &lsquo;overskilled&rsquo; - it shows
in the shrinking wage premium of college education.
There is no way for the whole majority to upskill  into the 1%.
Capitalism only gets more and more concentrated.</p>
<p>Number two: Keeping trade open will only increase the
process of capital concentration.
Liberalism has lost the globalization game due to it&rsquo;s <strong>blindness</strong>.</p>
<p>Today the setting is different:
There are other values than <em>entrepreneurial freedom and profit maximization</em>.
Liberalism has to take the back seat.
We need governments that aim for the collective health of the planet
and <em>scale down economic activity</em> for humankind to survive
it&rsquo;s own productivity.</p>
<p>The <em>breeding fascism</em> has to be countered by <em>redesigning society for
equality and collectivity,</em> not economic growth.</p>

      <description>Branko Milanovic thinks human needs are infinite and that both Keynes and Marx where wrong to think otherwise.
Even best among the economists, like Ricardo and Keynes (in “The economic prospects of our grandchildren”) thought that human needs are limited. We should know better today: the needs are unlimited and because we cannot forecast the exact movements in technology, we cannot forecast what particular form such new needs will take. But we know that our needs are not finite.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Branko Milanovic thinks
<a href="https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/robotics-or-fascination-with-anthropomorphism">human needs are infinite</a>
and that both Keynes and Marx where wrong to think otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>

But we know that our needs are not finite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg to differ (see comment on the above link):</p>
<p><em>Human needs are finite - capitalism&rsquo;s needs are infinite. Your argumentation is based on infinite capitalism. Today we should know better.</em></p>
<p>This caused <em>Pechmerle</em> to counter:</p>
<p><em>Human needs are not finite. This is partly a semantic issue - the definition of &ldquo;need.&rdquo; Perhaps if we spoke of &ldquo;wants&rdquo; instead, you would recognize that BM&rsquo;s comment is true.
Ten years ago I couldn&rsquo;t have got - and didn&rsquo;t know it would (or perhaps even then did) exist - classical radio over the internet.
Now that it does, readily, exist I am listening to a classical broadcast from France while typing this comment. I love this capability, and bought a stereo receiver that has the wifi utility built in.
There are many wants like this, and as BM postulates there will surely be many new ones we have not yet foreseen.
In my grandparents generation, radio broadcasts were at first non-existent, and then later something they consumed every single day.</em></p>
<p>My response to this was:</p>
<p><em>Wants are not needs. Wants are socially constructed. Most wants are unneeded.Why else would we &rsquo;need&rsquo; the marketing business?</em></p>
<p>Kevin Kelly adds in an <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-kevin-kelly-editor-author">interview with Noah Smith</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our technologies are ultimately not contrary to life, but are in fact an extension of life, enabling it to develop yet more options and possibilities at a faster rate. Increasing options and possibilities is also known as progress, so in the end, what the technium brings us humans is progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Technium</em> is Kelly-speak for &rsquo;the interacting web of technologies'.</p>
<p>So if technium  is part of life, then &lsquo;human&rsquo; needs will be infinite.
This seems to be the way Branko also is thinking.</p>
<p>But <em>are</em> technologies part of life?</p>
<p>And <em>are</em> progress the same as increasing options?</p>
<p>An isolated theoretical discussion of these isssues may be is a little far-fetched.
What is the <em>relevance</em> of those questions?</p>
<p>Both Marx and Keynes had a vision of <em>sufficiency</em> as the final outcome
of progress.
In the end human needs are finite and we have learned to live a life with
what we have and be happy with that.</p>
<p>This is of course contrary to capitalism&rsquo;s inherent need for accumulation.
History has constructed an economic system based on survival by growth.
If you don&rsquo;t grow your business you will go down.</p>
<p>In the last century, however, an environmental opposision to this worldview
emerged - the <em>sustainability</em> debate.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652611004987">Sorman and Giampietro (2013)</a> gives this nice summary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 1970s Ehrlich and Holdren proposed the</p>
<p>$$I = P A T$$</p>
<p>relation, where
I - Impact on the environment; P - Population; A - Afﬂuence;
T - Technology.</p>
<p>This relation indicates that the stress on both environment and
natural resources is due to a simultaneous increase of human
population (number of people - an extensive variable) and the
afﬂuence of society (the level of consumption per capita - an
intensive variable). The increase in the
two terms - P and A cannot be compensated by increases in
efﬁciency - T - that is, better technology.</p>
<p>The analysis of Ehrlich and Holdern developed a furious debate,
which, in the 1970s, divided the scientists concerned with
sustainability amid the two sides:</p>
<p>(i) The <em>cornucopians</em> - believers in the perpetual growth. For
those, regardless of whatever increase in P (population size)
and A (afﬂuence); this will always be compensated by an
increase in efﬁciency T (better technology/silver bullets); and</p>
<p>(ii) The <em>prophets of doom</em> - those saying that in a ﬁnite planet
perpetual growth is not possible, no matter what technology
will be invented. For them, all the three terms on the right side
of the equation (PAT) should be changed simultaneously, in an
integrated way, to maintain the activity of humankind within
the carrying capacity of our planet. We can recall here the
famous quote of Kenneth E. Boulding saying that: <em>“Anyone who
believes exponential growth can go on forever in a ﬁnite world is
either a madman or an economist”.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>After <em>Limits to Growth</em> in the 1970 the debate went out of steam as
the cornucopians seemed to have won during the neo-liberal era.
Now however the debate is back due to the relentless progress of
climate change - may be there are limits after all?</p>
<p>Of course, the declared <em>techo-optimists</em> are still fighting -
today under the name of <em>Green New Deal</em> or <em>Green Transition</em> -
capitalism is the solution to the problems capitalism has created -
growth can go on - human needs are infinite.</p>
<p>The <em>degrowth</em> camp fights back from the position of sufficiency happiness and
planetary boundaries to capitalisms expansion -
growth has to stop - human needs are finite.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s day 14 of Putins invasion in Ukraine.
More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled the bombardments.
Ukrainians are fighting heavily back - delaying the Russians.</p>
<p>Ukraine is asking Nato to establish a &lsquo;No-fly Zone&rsquo; - and enforce it!
Nato say&rsquo;s <strong>&lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong>.
Ukraine is asking for fighter jets.
Poland has offered Soviet-era MIGs - if the alliance takes the
responsibility of delivry into Ukraine. (Transfer them to Ramstein
and let the US send them to Ukraine).
The US say&rsquo;s <strong>&lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2008 the with it&rsquo;s in-famous Buchurest-declaration Nato offered
Georgia and Ukraine Nato membership prospects.
Georgian and Ukrainian right-wingers and nationalist put confidence
in these promises and started to feel strong - removing minority
protection regulations for Russians living in their countries.
Russia took action in South-Ossetia in Georgia in 2008 and in Crimea
in Ukraine in 2014.
In neither case Nato or the US were able to counter.
In 2022 with the full Russian occupation of Ukraine going on
Nato and the US once more pull back.</p>
<p>Nato&rsquo;s general secretary Jens Stoltenberg keeps talking:
<em>&lsquo;Every centimeter of Nato soil will be defended&rsquo;</em>
But is this trustworthy?</p>
<p>Some of my Norwegian friends are raising the prospect of Russian
occupation of Norwegian teritory: - Finnmark and The Svalbard Islands -
Russia creating another &lsquo;Buffer Zone&rsquo; towards Nato.
Norwegian forces on their own will not be able to withstand.
Norwegian defense policy is based on one card - Nato coming to the rescue.
A creeping doubt has entered from Ukraine: can we really rely on Nato?</p>
<p><em>Can we still rely on Nato?</em></p>
<p>The US is the core strength of Nato.
When Norway relies on Nato it is basically the US that delivers the guarantee.
In the US priorities are shifting.
Europe is no longer the major strategic interest for the US.
As <a href="https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4">John Mearsheimer puts it:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>America&rsquo;s Post-2000 strategic interests are: 1) Western Hemisphere 2) Asia 3) Persian Gulf and 4) Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US do not want to risk a military confrontation with Russia in Europe -
neither over Geogia, nor over Ukraine, nor over &hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>You can fill in what you think.
Will the US confront Russia over Finnmark? Svalbard? Estland? Latvia? Litauen?</p>
<p>The hard fact is that Europe&rsquo;s security arrangement has to be redesigned,
taking into account the new US disinterest as well as the Russian&rsquo;s need
for keeping Nato at a distance.</p>
<p>The Buchurest-declaration was a severe mistake.
Nato is not able to sustain its expansionism -
creating tradegies in Georgia and Ukraine.
Europe can no longer hide under the US umbrella.
Russia is a rising super-power that can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>If Europe wants to stand up against Putin&rsquo;s atrocities in Ukraine
it will have to do so on her own.
Today Europe is too weak and the US is looking elsewhere -
Putin will have it his way - in Georgia, Crimea, Ukraine, &hellip; &hellip;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To solve the <em>Climate Crisis</em> increasing economic productivity and energy efficiency
is not sufficient.
Absolute <em>decoupling</em> of economic growth and environmental degradition, including
global warming is not feasible (Hickel and Kallis (2019) Is Green Growth Possible?).
We will have to <strong>stop economic growth itself</strong> or even <strong>degrow</strong>  on a global scale.</p>
<p>Growth economists have always had models that in the long run end in a <em>steady state</em>.
That&rsquo;s just mathematics.
Many economists have been thinking about &lsquo;steady state economics&rsquo; for a long time.
Wikipedia has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_economy">overview</a>.</p>
<p>Most recent a new label has been introduced: <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics">&lsquo;Doughnut Economy&rsquo;</a>.
The focus is on defining the <em>limits</em> within which the economy can operate without harming
the environment on the one side and providing for a good life for everybody on the other side.
Also focused is the new <em>practises</em> people and businesses can apply in developing
sustainablity principles - moving from &rsquo;exstractive&rsquo; to &lsquo;generative&rsquo; enterprises.</p>
<p>This is the optimistic bottom-up movement of buidling new practises - and is certainly important.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is more pessimistic:</p>
<p>The world today consists also of the dark side: environmentally
harmfull &lsquo;practises&rsquo; on a large scale that have to be removed, and removed quickly.
These harmful practises contain the &rsquo;normal&rsquo;, &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; ways of operating
for businesses and working people all over the world.
The really hard task ahead is to knock down these practises.</p>
<p>So, implementing a steady state (or degrowth) economy <strong>now</strong> - due to the
climate urgency &rsquo; is quite another issue than small-scale development of &lsquo;doughnut economics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Herman Daly&rsquo;s famous book “A Steady-State Economy,” includes a 10-point
<em>Transition to a Steady State Economy (SSE)</em>-program.</p>
<p>Point 5 on the list is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Re-regulate international commerce—move away from free trade, free capital mobility and globalization, adopt compensating tariffs to protect efficient national policies of cost internalization from standards-lowering competition from other countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just this one point is a very tall order.
Actually, the task ahead is to <strong>undo all achievements of the liberal economic order that
has steered the world in recent decades</strong></p>
<p>How can it be done?</p>

      <description>There exists a well-known Swedish song from my childhood. It begins like this:
Lyckliga gatan, du finns inte mere Du er försvinnen med hela kvarteret ... In English the meaning would be:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There exists a well-known Swedish song from my childhood.
It begins like this:</p>
<pre><code>Lyckliga gatan, du finns inte mere
Du er försvinnen med hela kvarteret ...  
</code></pre>
<p>In English the meaning would be:</p>
<pre><code>Oh Happy Street of my Childhild you no more exits
You are now gone together with the whole quarter ...
</code></pre>
<p>The lyrics profondly catches the sorry mood of someone experiencing the arrival of
the &lsquo;Development Machine&rsquo; in their neigbourhood.</p>
<p>The time of writing was the 1960s with rapid urbanzation knocking down
happy shanty neigbourhoods bringing &lsquo;modernization&rsquo; - freeways and highrise.</p>
<h1 id="hit-by-development">Hit by Development</h1>
<p>People have been &lsquo;hit by development&rsquo; in this way for as long as capitalism has existed.
It all started with the expulsions from common land  - driving people off their
rural livelihood towards waged labour in the new industrial cities in England a
couple of centuries ago.</p>
<p>And it still goes on &hellip;</p>
<p>While the 1960s had the urbanization craze, the current development craze is &lsquo;Green Growth&rsquo;.
After the &rsquo;economic growth machinery&rsquo; destroyed the atmosphere by CO2-pollution,
global warming has forced governments to require &lsquo;Clean Growth&rsquo; or &lsquo;Green Growth&rsquo; -
still Growth, but no more pouring out climate gases.</p>
<p>At the core is the transition of electricity production from coal/oil/gas to wind/solar and other
renewable sources.
You can burn oil and gas at any time, but the wind and sun are erratic sources.
To ensure continous supply <em>energy storage</em> is required.
For short-duration energy storage batteries are the core option and among
batteries <em>lithium-ion</em> is the dominant technology of today.</p>
<p>Lithium is mostly produced in mines in Australia, Chile and China.
Europe has no lithium production of it&rsquo;s own.
The EU sees that as a strategic deficit - and are eagerly wanting
some supply&rsquo;s of its own.</p>
<h2 id="unhappy-portugal-hit-">Unhappy Portugal hit &hellip;</h2>
<p>Portugal has some lithium ore sites, and a British mining company has
acquired the rights to <em>develop</em> the mine.
But the local farming community don&rsquo;t want <em>development</em> - not even the
promise of 200 new jobs can get them hooked.
As one of the farmers say: <em>We don&rsquo;t want to be excavated and polluted for the
reason of Europeean cities to be cleaner</em>.</p>
<p>The full story <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/23/portuguese-village-suffers-the-high-cost-of-low-carbon-energy">here</a></p>
<h2 id="unhappy-sierra-leone-hit-">Unhappy Sierra Leone hit &hellip;</h2>
<p>Sierra Leone has beautiful beaches, national parks and thriving local fisheries.
But someone is out to &lsquo;destroy pristine rainforest, plunder fish stocks and pollute fish breeding grounds and several ecosystems&rsquo; - guess who?</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT! This time disguised by Chinese wanting to build a suitable landing port
for &ldquo;tuna and other bigger fishing” vessels exporting to international markets.</p>
<p>The gold and black sands of Black Johnson beach fringe the African nation’s Western Area Peninsula national park, home to endangered species including the duiker antelope and pangolins. The waters are rich in sardines, barracuda and grouper, caught by local fishermen who produce 70% of the fish for the domestic market.</p>
<p>The $55m  deal struck by the government of Sierra Leone with China to build an industrial fishing harbour on 100 hectares (250 acres) of beach and protected rainforest has been criticised as “a catastrophic human and ecological disaster” by conservationists, landowners and rights groups.</p>
<p>The full store [here](<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/17/sierra-leone-sells-rainforest-for-chinese-fishmeal-plant">Guardian</a></p>
<h2 id="unhappy-norway-hit-">Unhappy Norway hit &hellip;</h2>
<p>Norway has been a latecomer to wind-power exploitation.
As most of Norway&rsquo;s power production is hydro-based and thus already renewable, there
has simply not been a need for wind, before now &hellip;</p>
<p>New large scale electricity connection cables to neigboring countries (UK, Sweden, Denmark)
has opened up for unlimited electricty production - and someone wants to make profits.
So wind-power has come into the wind - even if Norwegians themselves do not need it.</p>
<p>So international wind capital has arrived also in Norway - whereever the wind blows a
windmill can be put up.
However, resistance is increasing: A survey found that 42 pct of population did not
want onshore windmills, up from 25 pct previous year. 2 of 3 is against windmills in
nature.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/rde/fig/vindkraftmotstand.jpeg" type="" alt=""  /></p>
<p><em>Picture: Mobilization against Wind Mill Development</em></p>
<h1 id="the-devil-in-development">The Devil in Development</h1>
<p>&lsquo;Development&rsquo; has become synonymous with &lsquo;Capitalistic Development&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The economy must grow! We need jobs! We cant live from fish and farming alone!</p>
<p>The argument list is long - so the unhappy people located near any exploitable
resource have no chance of stopping the &lsquo;Development Machine&rsquo;.
Protest, yes - but in the end &lsquo;Development&rsquo; always wins - even if new pollution and
nature destruction is part of play.</p>
<p>The devil in development is capitalism.</p>
<p>Our capability to think beyond capitalism is not great!</p>
<p>The resistance we can see everywhere, however, is a potential.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="nordic-differences">Nordic differences</h2>
<p>My Swedish friend Torbjörn just sent me a paper clip containing a notice of
a Swedish economics professor commenting on the economic situation in Norway.
<a href="https://www.dn.se/ledare/norsk-ekonomi-klarar-inte-bade-minskande-oljeintakter-och-hoga-ohalsotal/">Lars Calmfors in DN  22 feb 2021</a>. The notice is triggered by his involvement in a Norwegian
Green Paper Commision on Labour and Income Policy. <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/nou-2019-7/id2637967/">NOU 2019:7</a>. The Commision shouldpropose new measures to increase labour participation in Norway.</p>
<p>Internationally the Nordic (sometimes only Scandinavian) countries are
mostly treated as fairly much of the same under the heading of &lsquo;The Nordic Model&rsquo;.
This article however points to the particularities of Norway compared to Sweden.</p>
<p>Calmfors&rsquo;s main point is that Norway will not be able to tackle both decreasing oil returns
and high levels of health-related labour market absense when at the same time the population
is quickly aging.</p>
<p>As expected the economists look to &lsquo;increased labour market participation&rsquo; as the
&lsquo;key factor&rsquo; to tackle the problems Norway is now fronting.
(This was in their mandate).</p>
<p>Compared to Sweden the percentage of people living on health-related social contributions are
much higher in Norway (17 pct around the double of Sweden).
Calmfors interprets this figure av &lsquo;medicalization of labour market problems&rsquo; -
which might for sure be true.</p>
<p>When discussing what to do about this situation the differences to Sweden come to the surface.
The Nowegian way is quite more corporativistic than what could happen in Sweden.
After receiving expert proposals from the economists the Commision is enlarged with
participants from Employers and Labour Unions plus from Government.
Together they are charged with finding (for all) acceptable ways forwards.</p>
<p>This way of working together (3-party co-operation) to me lies at the heart of the &lsquo;Nordic Model&rsquo;,
so I am a bit surprised by learning from Calmfors that this is not the way it works in Sweden?
May be the &lsquo;Norwegian Model&rsquo; is not the same as the &lsquo;Nordic Model&rsquo; after all?
Calmfors&rsquo;s conclusion is that this cooperative mode paired with strong egalitarian drives
will create great obstacles for getting more people involved on the labour market.</p>
<p>May be he is right in this. But to me it sounds like an argument to skip the core of
the &lsquo;Norwegian Model&rsquo; - for something more neo-liberalistic?
That would be out of date. The Reagan-Thatcher era is long gone - if not yet
among mainstream economists.</p>
<p>However, to my mind Norway faces problems at the end of the oil age that calls for
looking much more broadly into the strategy of economic transition for the coming decades.
Strikingly the issue of greening the economy is out of focus for this commision.
But let me first take a look at the workings of the &lsquo;Norwegian Model&rsquo; - which has been
in operation from the mid 1930s up till now - and may be longer?</p>
<h2 id="the-norwegian-way">The Norwegian Way</h2>
<p>An interesting analysis of the &lsquo;Scandinavian Model&rsquo; is found in
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIiJOpyIXvAhXQMMAKHW3WDi8QFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flanekenworthy.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F01%2Freading-barthetal2014.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zxuWR3J6zGPD5AMEgo2H6">Barth 2014 (pdf)</a></p>
<p>The conclusion of this work is as follows (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why has the Scandinavian model worked so well? And, why have its
institutions and policies survived, in spite of changing economic and
political circumstances? Our answer to both questions is that there is a
<strong>strong complementarity between the Scandinavian non-market institutions
and capitalist dynamics</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our paper emphasizes the political–economic equilibrium between
three sets of mechanisms. Encompassing organizations in the labor
market follow a policy of wage coordination and wage compression,
with a strong preference for full employment in central bargaining
and microeconomic efficiency in local bargaining. Wage compression
leads to a <strong>higher pace of creative destruction</strong> and further wage compression
with an increasing average wage. More wage equality and higher
average wages fuel the political support for welfare spending. There
might even be a feedback from public welfare policies to productivity
rise and further wage compression. This complementarity explains
why the same outcomes—efficiency and a high level of equality—could
not have been achieved by redistribution through the political system
alone.
This political-economic equilibrium path has benefitted from consistent
policies that have supplemented market forces. Active labor market
programs and moderations on employment protection have been important
policies to facilitate structural change and reallocation of labor
without excessive wage differentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A similar concern for consistency is evident from the extensive use of
‘work-fare’ policies, which are used in Denmark, Norway and Sweden to
ensure that work pays in the presence of generous welfare benefits.
High employment reduces the cost of a generous benefit system and increases the tax base.
Active job search or qualification efforts are for example required in order to obtain unemployment benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In sum, the complementarity between the non-market institutions
and capitalist investments help explain why the main institutions and
policies have survived over 80 years. The gains are spread widely across
groups. There are many winners and few losers. Both low paid groups
and employers are clear winners as <strong>wage compression and rising profits
are two sides of the same coin</strong>. High skilled workers are potential losers.
But also high skilled workers may gain from wage moderation, as the
average productivity goes up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The stability of the Scandinavian model can in part be explained by
the good performance, and the good performance must have been
helped by the stability of the model. The key is that both depend on
the egalitarian aspects of the Scandinavian model that share the gains
of good performance on almost all groups. Since the interactions be-
tween wage coordination, investments, and welfare spending all
strengthen the egalitarian aspects of the model, it would not be possible
to achieve the same egalitarian results by redistribution through the
welfare state only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So - the &lsquo;Nordic / Scandinavian / Norwegian Model&rsquo; turns out to be just
a smart way to let capitalism evolve.
And it has worked well - on that premise - so far.</p>
<p>The model&rsquo;s &lsquo;golden age&rsquo; was before 1980.
But the neoliberal era - from 1980 onwards has created some dilemmas-
which might be read in the constant decline of the labour parties in
all the Nordic countries during the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>The alliance between Labour and Capital was based on mutual benefits:
Labour Organizations accepted wage restraints as long as capitalist
continued investing in project that created increade number of jobs.
However in the 1980&rsquo;s this closed loop was broken be globalization.
Capitalist&rsquo;s started putting the money into China and other developing
countries instead of investing at home.
Labour is no longer on the winning side of the play.
The gains are no longer as widely spread across groups.
As in other countries there is a rising precariate.</p>
<p>This has been most visible in the other Nordic countries - for Norway
the oil money came in between as a saving angel - allowing for
such &rsquo;economic diseases&rsquo; as 17% health-related social contributions to
people not participating in the labour market.
Thus, the coming end of the oil era put Norway up for greater challenges
than the other Nordic countries, as Calmfors rightly explained.</p>
<p>To green the economy while at the same time get out of &lsquo;oil addiction&rsquo;
is really a double challenge.</p>
<p>To find the way forwards one will need a lot more than main-stream
econmic thinking a la Calmfors.</p>
<p>A starting point could be an &rsquo;evolutionary economics&rsquo; approach.
Interesting extension in the understanding of how the &lsquo;Norwegian Model&rsquo; works
come from <a href="https://evonomics.com/norway-toxic-trickle-down-david-sloan-wilson/">Wlison and Hessen (2015)</a>.
(My emphasis)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The success of the so-called “Nordic Model” is commonly attributed to factors such as income equality, a high level of trust, high willingness to pay tax, which is tightly coupled to strong social security (health, education), a blend of governmental regulations and capitalism, and cultural homogeneity. These and other factors are important, but we think that viewing them through an evolutionary lens is likely to shed light on why they are important. Our hypothesis is that <strong>Norway functions well as a nation because it has successfully managed to scale up the social control mechanisms that operate spontaneously in village-sized groups</strong>. Income equality, trust, and the other factors attributed to Norway’s success emanate from the social control mechanisms.</p>

<p>Trump is a smart entrepreneur - first in business, then in politics.
Before other he saw the vote potential in the resentment against this new aristocracy -
The Washington Swamp.</p>
<p>Trump succeeded in creating a bizarre aliance between ultra-rich
and the left-behinds of the neoliberal era -
picking up enough votes to start an attack on the ruling aristocracy.</p>
<p>230 years have gone since the French Revolution -
and we still have not seen the return of the pitchforks.</p>
<p>Obama sold &lsquo;change&rsquo; without delivering.
Trump makes &lsquo;change&rsquo;, but only for the benefit of the ultra-rich.
His attacks on the aristocracy in Washington is enough to get him going
with the resentfull.</p>
<p>The aristocracy managed to overturn their 2016-loss with at call
for &lsquo;healing of the nation&rsquo;.
But how should this healing occur?
Only removal of the aristocracy will satisfy the resentfull.
That will not happen witouth the pitchforks.
Some time soon  there is worse to come.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;The Climate Crisis is Capitalism&rsquo;s Waterloo&rdquo;</em> (Yanis Varoufakis)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; is a label for highly upredictable events with extreme impacts.
The concept was made popular by Nassim Nicholas Taleb with his 2007 book of
the same title. Some will say the Financial Crisis in 2008 was a black swan.
As Queen Elizabeth famously asked the community of Britsish Economists:
&ldquo;Why did nobody see this coming?&rdquo; - Although <em>some</em> saw it coming, but not among
the mainstream scholars. Taleb - a former options trader - has later build a
whole theory around the &lsquo;Black Swan&rsquo; - in his five volume Opus Magnus, &lsquo;Incerto&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now BIS - the Central Bank&rsquo;s &lsquo;Central Bank&rsquo; (Bank of International Settlements in Basel)
has introduced &ldquo;The Green Swan&rdquo; another name for the Climate Crisis as it dawns upon
the community of Central Bankers.</p>
<p>The alarm bells has finally started ringing in the &lsquo;Core of Capitalism&rsquo;.
2019 was the year not only Central Bankers got concerned - even Wall Street is worrying.</p>
<p>The OECD is trying to coordinate the worrying, talking about &lsquo;A New Economic Approach&rsquo;
&lsquo;Beyond Growth&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Only Yanis Varoufakis uses the term &lsquo;Capitalism&rsquo; - and speaks as if some Non-Capitalistic
System really might emerge.
Others stay away from naming &lsquo;The System&rsquo; - and are more concerned about its &lsquo;stability&rsquo; -
focusing on &lsquo;resilience&rsquo; - i.e. how to make Capitalism <em>survive</em> the Climate Crisis.
Naomi Klein&rsquo;s 2014 book &lsquo;This Changes Everything&rsquo; concluded that Capitalism as such
really was what created the Climate Crisis. To get out of the Crisis we would have to
abandon the system itself. But the others have not yet reached such a conclusion.</p>
<p>Some don&rsquo;t like the term &lsquo;Capitalism&rsquo; at all.
John Kay wish we did not use it - thinking it is an obsolete label for today&rsquo;s
economic system.</p>
<p>The ongoing debate is an entertaining exposition of sliding concepts and language -
however, on a very dark and solemn background.</p>
<p>The major divide is between those advocating &lsquo;Green Growth will solve the Problem&rsquo;
and those saying &lsquo;Growth is the Problem, even if it is green&rsquo;. Among the latter
are Jason Hickel and Giorgis Kallis.
This hinges on the very question of whether Capitalism is possible without Growth.
Production for <em>Profit</em> is the core of Capitalism and thus <em>Growth</em>.
&lsquo;Akkumulieren, akkumulieren, dass ist Moses und die Propheten&rsquo; as old Marx put it.</p>
<p>If planetary boundaries forces growth of today&rsquo;s economic system to stop - it
will no longer be Capitalism.</p>

Of particular interest I found the contribution of Antoinette Schoar (MIT Sloan) -

<p><em>Antoinette Schoar looks at the financial market, argues that the rapid growth of new digital technologies has created a market dynamic, where many institutions outside the central bank system might soon have much more comprehensive, more accurate and also more timely information than the regulators. Companies like Google or Amazon can use their data to predict regional sales growth or job losses. Google Trends is just one example of the power of aggregation from individual search information. This poses a challenge going forward that is structural and intellectual. On the one hand we need to think about how central banks can get visibility of the types of data that private-sector institutions are collecting as part of their core business. On the intellectual side the availability of this hyper-granular data asks for a new way of building economic models based on individual purchase or borrowing decisions. This is a challenge to the whole field of (macro)economics.</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mainstream economics failure to &lsquo;see the crisis coming&rsquo; in 2008
is broadly regarded as a deficiency of the theory.
However, Paul Krugman now argues that the theory was - and is - &lsquo;good
enough for government&rsquo;. The failure of 2008 was not in the theory,
but rather in deficient <em>data collection</em>. Macroeconomists &ldquo;overlooked&rdquo;
the institutional changes in the financial sector
and did not record appropriate data.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;New Keynesians&rdquo; - i.e. Krugman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saltwater School&rsquo; based at
MIT and Harvard - took up the challenge by <em>dust[ing] off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Very large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates.</li>
<li>Even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates.</li>
<li>There would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Krugman argues that these propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008 which worked “remarkably well.”
This New Keynesian policy was a succes - in contrast to the more inflexible
responses promoted by the &lsquo;Freshwater - Chicago School&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, fiscal expansion was soon replaced by austerity.</p>
<p>Krugman&rsquo;s version is not taken at face value by Robert Skidelsky who
argues that <em>when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons. Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times. Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved. They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental.</em></p>
<p><em>Without acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart. New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job. So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive. Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.</em></p>

      <description>The Thai districts on the Myanmar border have very mixed ethnic groups and a rough history:
The Shan are not the only ethnic group living here. Ban Mae Aeb is a small village comprising five ethnic groups living togetger. Besides the Shan, the village is home to Chinese, Lahu, Akha and Lua.
The &amp;ldquo;Lost Army&amp;rdquo; - the republic of China&amp;rsquo;s 93rd Division - fled into Burma after their defeat to the communist.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Thai districts on the Myanmar border have very mixed ethnic groups
and a rough history:</p>
<p>The Shan are not the only ethnic group living here.
Ban Mae Aeb is a small village comprising five ethnic groups living togetger.
Besides the Shan, the village is home to Chinese, Lahu, Akha and Lua.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Lost Army&rdquo; - the republic of China&rsquo;s 93rd Division - fled into Burma
after their defeat to the communist.
The Chinese Nationalist troop tried to attack Yunnan province in China,
but were pushed into Burma.
Then they were pressured by the Burmese army to move out.</p>
<p>Whereever the Lost Army passed, people from ethnic villages were forced to
join them.
Men were recruited as porters or soldiers while women were cooks and nurses.</p>
<p>The Lost Army swept villages and left no one behind.
The remnants of the Lost Army sought asylum and settled along the
Chiang Rai border, particularily in the mountainous areas.
In exchange for asylum, they fought for Thailand against communists
along the northern border.</p>
<p>Today, descendants of the Lost Army can be found in Doi Mae Salong and
other places along the Chiang Rai border.</p>
<p>Though the villages grew with different ethnic groups, Chinese remains
the village&rsquo;s official language.</p>

      <description>Yesterday I got a reminder from Mars! There is a &amp;lsquo;Starmus&amp;rsquo; conference going on these days, in Trondheim, Norway. One astronaut told about returning to Earth after 43 days in Space - the message being that what you don&amp;rsquo;t use (in Space) you have lost when back (on Earth) - i.e. without gravity your sense of balance get lost - you have to retrain basic mobility capabilities upon return.
So also for elderly people - without exercising mind and body capabilities get lost.</description>

<p>Beware also the mental vulnurality. Who recalls phone numbers these days?
Say your phone got missed and you need to ask someone else to make a call
for you - would you be able to tell the number to dial?</p>

President of the U.S. European leaders for the first time in postwar history
finds they can no longer trust the U.S. Government. Neither in defence (Nato),
climate change (Paris Accord) or trade (TTIP). We are experiencing the slow
collapse of the hegemonic US era. Gone are the days of the Washington Concensus
and the Neoliberal economic doctrine. The EU establishment seems though to
still cling to these - Merkel &amp; Macron want to pick up the flag abandonned
by the US and to take on a European leadership of prolonged globalisation.
Alas, watershed periods starts with confusion and nostalgia.
Forwards-looking policies are still waiting to emerge.</p>
